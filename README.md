This project, called Digital Library Organizer, is basically a simple system that helps manage and organize books. It’s built to show how programming concepts like recursion and binary search trees work in real applications.

Here’s how it functions in plain terms:

Library Categories (Recursion) –
This part lists books under their categories, like Fantasy, Mystery, or Non-Fiction.
It uses recursion, meaning it automatically goes through every category and subcategory to display all the books neatly.

Book Lookup and Binary Search Tree (BST) –
The search bar helps you find a book quickly by title.
Behind the scenes, the system uses a Binary Search Tree to sort books alphabetically, making the search faster and more organized.

Manage Books (CRUD) –
This section is where you can add, view, and delete books.
You can type in the title, author, year, and genre to add a new one, and if you don’t need it anymore, you can remove it using the delete button.

In short, it’s like a mini library system that shows how data can be stored, searched, and displayed efficiently — clean, simple, and smart.
